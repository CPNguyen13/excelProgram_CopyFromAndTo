# excelProgram_CopyFromAndTo
I started the idea and creation of this program about 6 months ago (10/2018) in order to save time from doing a daily,tedious task at work. There are still some bugs/potential bugs and other problems to look out for which will be noted below (feel free to add more!).

Copies all records from all team members excel files from a particular date (based on previous working day, Column A) to a target (Main) file that wholes all records from each individual into one Excel file.
